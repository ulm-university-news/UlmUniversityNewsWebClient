index.about.title = What is University News Ulm?
index.about.text1 = University News Ulm (UNU) has been created in 2016 in the focus project Advanced Mobile \
  Application Engineering at the Institute of Databases and Information Systems at the University of Ulm.
index.about.text2 = The main task of UNU is the distribution of information about certain topics. There are channels \
  which cover specific topics. Channels can be subscribed by users in order to receive announcements which are \
  sent by responsible channel moderators. This enables to quickly distribute information to persons who are \
  interested in the specific topic. A channel can be used, for instance, to inform users about an unexpected location \
  change of a lecture or remind them of new worksheets. Channels can also cover topics such as a university party \
  and distribute information about the tickets, especially where to get them.
index.about.text3 = The web client is intended to support the administration and management of channels. Moderators \
  of channels can, for instance, send new announcements or create reminders. The same can already be done using the \
  UNU app, however, the web client enables to do certain tasks more easily.
index.about.text4 = Users can utilize the app to subscribe to channels. The distribution of information within the \
  channels enables users to stay up-to-date on the topics they are interested in. Users can configure the \
  notification behavior of the app and specify which announcements require a notification in a fine grained way. The \
  goal is to make information available in a manner that makes it less likely for users to miss something important. \
  Furthermore, the app enables to create groups. Main purpose of a group is to provide a closed area in which members \
  of the group can share information and organize themselves. Within a group, it is possible to chat about certain \
  topics and also to create and perform ballots on them.
index.about.text5 = The UNU system consists of this Web Client, an associated REST Server and Apps for Android and \
  Windows Phone. All these components were developed by Matthias Mak and Philipp Speidel. Manager of the \
  project is Marc Schickler.
